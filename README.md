## Git class 2023 exercise

It's an exercise for a Git class I followed in 2023.

> "A description of rare clarity and insight"
> -- TÃ©lÃ©rama

> "Reading the README.md file really bring the author's work
> into a new perspective, in that you actually know what they
> did or at least meant to do."
> -- The Times

> "What's a Git class ?"
> -- Your elderly family member, probably.
